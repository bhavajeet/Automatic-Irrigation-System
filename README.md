# Automatic-Irrigation-System
we are making an Automatic Irrigation System with an Arduino Uno which will irrigate your plants automatically and keep them healthy even when you are out of the town for weeks or months. In this project, a Moisture sensor will be used to maintain the optimum level of moisture for your plants. This system can be implemented, both for your garden or for your Indoor plants thus taking care of your leafy pets when you are away.
